## UT2kx Reg check

Version: 1.0  
Author: Head  
Operating systems: WIN 95/98/ME/2K/XP/LH

Thank you for downloading my small registry check tool.

The major task of this tool is to add your CD-Key and UT2kx-path to the windows-registry (after a format c:, if you lost your registry or in other cases). Additional you are able to view/change your CD-Key and your UT2kx-path in a simple and easy way.

You can individually add UT2kx UMods, UT2kx links, UT2kx maps, unreal protocol or the UT2kx uninstall information in all languages which ut2kx supports to the registry.
It's now also possible to switch between the versions of UT, if you install UT2004 you won't be able to use the .ut2 files with UT2003 anymore.

Note: UT2kx RegCheck will only change the language of the error messages (for example if you have forgotten to insert your game disc) not the language of the game.

If you want to change the UT2kx-path and CD-Key (if you already installed UT2kx) simply click on "allow changes", make your changes and press insert.
